            <p>Hello! My name is McKenna Johnson. I'm a stay-at-home mom living in Cache Valley, Utah. I'm orginally from North Dakota + Kansas, but moved to Utah when I was 8. My husband and I met working together at a bakery my senior year of high school,
                and stayed in contact while we both served LDS missions to North Dakota and Toronto, Canada. We have now been married for almost 8 years, and we are parents to the most adorable almost three year old boy. 
                I'm a crazy cat lady, dedicated project seeker, culinary wizard, and would happily ride my bike or read books all day with my family if I could. I am a big fan of fantasy/science fiction novels, and make it a priority to rewatch The Lord of the Rings Extended Edition at least once per year. 
                I earned my Associates Degree from Utah State University in 2018, and I'm now back in school to make a career change and earn a degree in software development.  </p>

            <img src="images/utah.jpg" alt="Utah City Landscape" width="200">
            <p>Utah is a lovely landlocked state in the USA. It boasts a wide variety of environments for all outdoor enthusiasts, from red rock arches and canyons, fresh and saltwater lakes, mountains for hiking,
                mountain biking, and skiing, and several beautiful pine forests. If you like being outside, there are plenty of options! The larger cities, such as Salt Lake City and Lehi are also a hotbed for tech development, education, and the arts.
