            <p>Hello! My name is McKenna Johnson. I'm a stay-at-home mom living in Cache Valley, Utah. I'm a crazy cat lady, dedicated project seeker, a culinary wizard, 
                and would happily ride my bike or read books all day with my family if I could. After an almost 6 year break, I'm back in school to earn a degree in software development.</p>

            <p>Utah is a lovely landlocked state in the USA. It boasts a wide variety of environments for all outdoor enthusiasts, from red rock arches and canyons, fresh and saltwater lakes, mountains for hiking,
                mountain biking, and skiing, and several beautiful pine forests. If you like being outside, there are plenty of options! The larger cities, such as Salt Lake City and Lehi are also a hotbed for tech development, education, and the arts.
